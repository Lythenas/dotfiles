# Dotfiles

My dotfiles are managed by [stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) (see http://brandon.invergo.net/news/2012-05-26-using-gnu-stow-to-manage-your-dotfiles.html for a good explanation).

## Installation and Usage

I prefer to clone this repo to `~/dotfiles` but you could choose a different location.

1. `git clone https://github.com/Lythenas/dotfiles ~/dotfiles`
1. `cd ~/dotfiles`
1. run `stow $package` for every `$package` you want to use the config
